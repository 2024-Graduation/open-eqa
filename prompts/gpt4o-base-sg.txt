You will be shown a set of images that have been collected from a single indoor location.
You should make a Scenegraph based on the information you found out from a set of images.
I will give the Scenegraph structure.
You must print 'Scenegraph' to 'text', following the structure you got.
Remember, Scenegraph should be in 'text', not json, css or other code file.
Scenegraph:
{
    "scenegraph": {
      "rooms": [
        {
          "name": "Unknown Room 1",
          "objects": [
            {
              "name": "Unknown Object 1",
              "color": "Unknown",
              "state": "Unknown",
              "relationships": {
                "left": [],
                "right": [],
                "on": [],
                "above": [],
                "under": []
              },
              "notes": "Unknown"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }, 
    "answer": "Unknown"
  }
